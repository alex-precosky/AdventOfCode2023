# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions to the 2023 Advent of code problems: https://adventofcode.com/2023

# Requirements

- python 3.10+
- pytest

# Run

Each solution is in a file named after what day's problem that solution is for. To run the day 1 solution, simply run:

python day01.py

# Testing

From the project directory, run the unit tests for a day with:

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD
pytest test/test_day01.py
```
